# Virus Predictor

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# Require_relative connects the code to another document of code. Where location of the doc is represented as relative from where the oringial code is located.

# Reflection Section

# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# => The inner hash has symbols for their keys, and the outer hash has strings
# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# => require_relative connects two different docs of code together and unlike require it bases its 'search' for the other doc based on the location of the calling doc.
# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# => while/until/for loops, #each method (#each also have specific verisions for key and value) 
# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# => They were redundant. They were already accessible so we didn't need they as arguments in the methods.
# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
