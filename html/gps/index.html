<!--
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to div up the html structure for clarity. The ones that I see a most useful is the footer and article. Footer because it's clear where the element is going, and article for clarity as well.

The browser will move from top to bottom for displaying each element.

I learned in this challenge that sublime is very customizable. I will most definitely be using the snippet tool for structured code.

The most confusing part of this challenge for me was the different names for all of the semantic tags. But through discusion with my pair and the guide, it makes more sense. The names arn't for the browser but it's for the coder, clarifying what each section is, or should be.
