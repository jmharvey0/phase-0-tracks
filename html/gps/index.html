<!-- REFLECTION -->
<!--1) HTML tags help prevent the  "div soup" problem. Before HTML 5 every section was demarcatd with <div>, which made it very hard to scan the document and get an overall idea of its contents at a glance. Semantic tags help provide structure, so that it's possible to grasp the structure and layout of a page even at a quick glance -->
<!-- HTML will always load first and it is always interpreted from top to bottom -->
<!--3) Sublime allows you to save shortcuts with snippets and I'm confident that will prove *INCREDIBLY* helpful moving forward. -->
<!--4) The concept that it is possible to use CSS and Javascript within an HTML tag is one that I had a hard time with, and one that I'm still trying to unpack. I still don't totally get it, so probably makes sense to read around on the internet and see what I can learn. -->
