<p>One of the best ways to learn about banana art is to look to Japan. To quote the travel blog <a href="https://www.tsunagujapan.com/30-pictures-of-amazing-banana-art/">Tsunagu Japan</a>, "Some Japanese people find the limited space and size of bananas to be a challenge and so carving expressions into them is a pastime that is getting more and more popular." As always, Japan is ahead of the curve! Not just in banana art--also in the beauty of their html websites :) </p>
