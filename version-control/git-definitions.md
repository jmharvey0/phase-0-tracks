# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. It is helpful bc it provides a way to roll back the document to any point in the past, if you need to. It's like using the "Save as Copy" feature in GoogleDocs :)

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch provides a copy of a project to work on. When work is done, changes can be merged back to the master branch. You use a branch to make changes so that you don't accidentally crash and burn on the master branch and mess up everything.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is basically hitting save on your code. Every commit should be accompanied by a commit message explaining the changes that have been made in that version of the code, as that makes for easier navigation later.

* What is a merge conflict?
Did we learn this? I don't think we learned this. But I have consulted the internet, and the answer is as follows: If two people changed the same lines of the same file, (for example, if one person decided to delete the line while the other person decided to modify it) Git simply cannot know what is correct. Git will then mark the file as having a conflict - which you'll have to resolve before you can continue your work.

I am making one final update just to see if I can track it with a commmit!

Trying this one more time.
