# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is saving multiple versions of a project. It's useful because you can implement changes to a project and easily revert it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a seperate version of a file that isn't part of the main file. You would use it for editting, each branch having a different change to the file, but without affecting the main file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a saving of a branch with a message attached that succinctly describes the changes done. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when Git doesn't know what to do with changes to a file. An example of this is when two people change the same lines of code, but one modifies them and the other deletes them.
